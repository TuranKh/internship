# Movie Page Development Task

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a responsive and interactive web application for a movie streaming platform. Interns are expected to implement the front-end components, ensuring that the design is adaptive and functional across different devices.

## Requirements

### Design
- The web interface must be responsive, ensuring it looks good on both mobile and desktop screens.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **Styling:** CSS, preferably with a pre-processor like SASS 

### Features

1. **Search Functionality**
   - Implement a server-side search to allow users to find movies and shows based on title, actors, or genres. The backend should handle the query and return relevant results to the frontend.

2. **Grouping by Genre**
   - Movies and shows should be grouped by their genre on the client side. This allows users to browse categories easily.

3. **Play Video on Hover**
   - When a user hovers over a movie thumbnail, the trailer or a short clip of the movie should start playing. Ensure that this does not cause performance issues or excessive bandwidth usage.

4. **Like and Sound Toggle**
   - Users should be able to 'like' movies and toggle sound on/off on the trailers playing on hover.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible and user-friendly.
- Consider implementing lazy loading for images and videos to improve page load times.
